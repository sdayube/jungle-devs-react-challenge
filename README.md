# Jungle Devs React Challenge

This project was developed by me, Silvio Dayube, as a technical challenge from Jungle Devs. THe main objective was to replicate a ready-made design shared through Figma.

## How to run the development build?

To run the development build, first clone the repo using the `git clone` command on your favorite CLI. Then, considering that you already have Node installed and updated, use `npm install` to install the project dependencies. This may take a while, but after it's done you'll  be ready to run the project in development mode and alter it as you see fit!

To finally run the project, simply run `npm start`. Since this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), Babel and Webpack will already be configured to make their magic work behind the screens, giving you a local host address to access the page, with hot reloading as a plus.


## How to create a production build?

To create a production build, run the `npm run build` command on your CLI. Then you'll have a production ready build in the `build` folder.

As per Create React App's instructions, this method correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. All that is missing then is the deployment step, which is out of this project's scope!

See the Create React App [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section if you are interested in learning more.

## Feedbacks and final thoughts

I really enjoyed building this project. It was the perfect opportunity for me to start learning `axios`, since it was mentioned to be important in the interview, and to apply my recently acquired `Sass` knowledge in a challenge in which CSS preprocessing actually makes sense.

It was also my first time building a landing page with React, since we focus more on SPAs and applications with more complex functionalities at the Trybe course, so my last time building a landing page was with vanilla JS and HTML, when i created my [portfolio page](https://sdayube.github.io) on GitHub Pages.

I feel I have done a precise job replicating the design and making it responsive, and I also tried to keep a good level of modularity within the code to make it easier to change or maintain. Overall, I'm proud of what I build and think I did a good enough job!
